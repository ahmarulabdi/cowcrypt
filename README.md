CowCrypt: API Documentation
---------------------------
---------------------------
#### Introduction
Welcome to the CowCrypt API documentation. Use the sidebar links to learn more
about CowCrypt's classes.

CowCrypt provides popular hashing
and encryption algorithms for the MooTools JavaScript framework. My goal is to
provide much of the same robust functionality as the crypto-js library, but
with the elegance and familiar syntax of MooTools. The code is licensed under
the MIT License.

This is a pretty technical doc, so check out these links if you're confused.
